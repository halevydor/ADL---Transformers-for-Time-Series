# Robust Air Pollutant Forecasting with Time‚ÄëSeries Transformers

This repository contains the notebook and materials for a comparative study of **Time‚ÄëSeries Transformers (TST)** ‚Äî **Informer**, **PatchTST**, and **Crossformer** ‚Äî against an **N‚ÄëBEATS** baseline for forecasting air pollutants (NO, NO‚ÇÇ, NOx, O‚ÇÉ, PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ) under **limited‚Äëdata** constraints.

We evaluate models on two climatically distinct regions in Israel (Mediterranean vs. desert), using a **single monitoring station per region**. All models share a unified pipeline: **120‚Äëhour look‚Äëback** ‚Üí **24‚Äëhour forecast**, repeated over a **7‚Äëday** test horizon, and are compared with **RRMSE** as the primary metric.

## üîß Environment Setup

We recommend Python 3.10‚Äì3.11.

```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Upgrade pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üì¶ Model Implementations

The study used public implementations for each architecture. Because some repos are **not pip‚Äëinstallable** as packages, we recommend adding them as git submodules (or cloning into a `models/` folder) and importing from source:

```bash
mkdir -p models && cd models

# Crossformer (official)
git clone https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Crossformer.git

# PatchTST (reference implementation)
git clone https://github.com/yuqinie/patchtst.git

# Informer (reference ‚Äî often distributed within FEDformer forks or dedicated repos)
git clone https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020.git

cd ..
```

Then, in scripts/notebooks, add the paths to `sys.path` before imports, e.g.:

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.join("models", "Crossformer"))
sys.path.append(os.path.join("models", "patchtst"))
sys.path.append(os.path.join("models", "Informer2020"))
```

> If your local code already contains adapted copies of these models, you can skip cloning and use your versions directly.

## üß™ Reproducing the Study (outline)

1. **Data preparation**  
   - Align meteorological + air‚Äëquality data to hourly resolution (2020‚Äë03‚Äë09 ‚Üí 2022‚Äë12‚Äë31).  
   - Apply a **3‚Äëhour lag** to meteorology to sync with pollutant readings.  
   - Clean missing/invalid values and **Akima** interpolation where appropriate.  
   - Train/val/test split: **train to 2022‚Äë06‚Äë01**, **val = last 20% of train**, **test = final 7 days**.  
   - Feature scaling fitted **only on train**, applied to val/test.

2. **Windowing**  
   - Input: **120 hours**; Output: **next 24 hours** (rolling, 7 daily windows).

3. **Training**  
   - Loss: **MSE**, Optimizer: **Adam**.  
   - Early stopping (patience = 8) on validation loss.  
   - Fix seeds where supported.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Primary metric: **Relative RMSE (RRMSE)**, averaged over the 7 daily windows per pollutant.  
   - Save predictions and ground truths for analysis; record training runtimes.

5. **Notes per model**  
   - **PatchTST**: univariate‚Äëtarget runs (separate model per pollutant) in the common implementation.  
   - **Crossformer / Informer**: multivariate‚Äëtarget runs (predict all 5 pollutants together).

## üìä Key Findings (high‚Äëlevel)

- **PatchTST** often yields the lowest RRMSE, especially for **O‚ÇÉ** and **PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ**.  
- **Crossformer** is typically second‚Äëbest in accuracy and **fastest to train**.  
- **Informer** underperforms on **NO** in our setup.  
- Across both regions, TSTs generally **outperform** the single **N‚ÄëBEATS** baseline; hybrid/ensemble approaches are a promising next step.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

Open the notebook in `notebooks/`, update paths to your `data/` and `models/` folders if needed, and run the cells top‚Äëto‚Äëbottom.

## üì§ How to Publish to GitHub (Quick Steps)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (public or private).  
2. In your project folder locally:
   ```bash
   git init
