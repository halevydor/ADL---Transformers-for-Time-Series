# Robust Air Pollutant Forecasting with Time‑Series Transformers

This repository contains the notebook and materials for a comparative study of **Time‑Series Transformers (TST)** — **Informer**, **PatchTST**, and **Crossformer** — against an **N‑BEATS** baseline for forecasting air pollutants (NO, NO₂, NOx, O₃, PM₂.₅) under **limited‑data** constraints.

We evaluate models on two climatically distinct regions in Israel (Mediterranean vs. desert), using a **single monitoring station per region**. All models share a unified pipeline: **120‑hour look‑back** → **24‑hour forecast**, repeated over a **7‑day** test horizon, and are compared with **RRMSE** as the primary metric.

## Environment Setup

We recommend Python 3.10–3.11.

```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Upgrade pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Implementations

The study used public implementations for each architecture. Because some repos are **not pip‑installable** as packages, we recommend adding them as git submodules (or cloning into a `models/` folder) and importing from source:

```bash
mkdir -p models && cd models

# Crossformer (official)
git clone https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Crossformer.git

# PatchTST (reference implementation)
git clone https://github.com/yuqinie/patchtst.git

# Informer (reference — often distributed within FEDformer forks or dedicated repos)
git clone https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020.git

cd ..
```

Then, in scripts/notebooks, add the paths to `sys.path` before imports, e.g.:

```python
import sys, os
sys.path.append(os.path.join("models", "Crossformer"))
sys.path.append(os.path.join("models", "patchtst"))
sys.path.append(os.path.join("models", "Informer2020"))
```

> If your local code already contains adapted copies of these models, you can skip cloning and use your versions directly.

## Reproducing the Study (outline)

1. **Data preparation**  
   - Align meteorological + air‑quality data to hourly resolution (2020‑03‑09 → 2022‑12‑31).  
   - Apply a **3‑hour lag** to meteorology to sync with pollutant readings.  
   - Clean missing/invalid values and **Akima** interpolation where appropriate.  
   - Train/val/test split: **train to 2022‑06‑01**, **val = last 20% of train**, **test = final 7 days**.  
   - Feature scaling fitted **only on train**, applied to val/test.

2. **Windowing**  
   - Input: **120 hours**; Output: **next 24 hours** (rolling, 7 daily windows).

3. **Training**  
   - Loss: **MSE**, Optimizer: **Adam**.  
   - Early stopping (patience = 8) on validation loss.  
   - Fix seeds where supported.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Primary metric: **Relative RMSE (RRMSE)**, averaged over the 7 daily windows per pollutant.  
   - Save predictions and ground truths for analysis; record training runtimes.

5. **Notes per model**  
   - **PatchTST**: univariate‑target runs (separate model per pollutant) in the common implementation.  
   - **Crossformer / Informer**: multivariate‑target runs (predict all 5 pollutants together).

## Key Findings (high‑level)

- **PatchTST** often yields the lowest RRMSE, especially for **O₃** and **PM₂.₅**.  
- **Crossformer** is typically second‑best in accuracy and **fastest to train**.  
- **Informer** underperforms on **NO** in our setup.  
- Across both regions, TSTs generally **outperform** the single **N‑BEATS** baseline; hybrid/ensemble approaches are a promising next step.
